Integrate with major GDS (Global Distribution Systems) and airline booking APIs.
Develop a feature for dynamic rebooking in case of cancellations or delays.


Accommodation Booking:

Create a recommendation system for personalized accommodation suggestions based on user preferences and past bookings.
Integrate with hotel booking platforms like Booking.com and Expedia via their APIs.


Activity and Restaurant Recommendations:

Develop an AI model to suggest local activities and restaurants based on user interests and travel destination.
Integrate with review sites like TripAdvisor for up-to-date information and ratings.


Calendar and Email Integration:

Implement functionality to analyze user's calendar and email to suggest optimal travel dates and destinations.
Use OAuth for secure access to calendar data (support Google Calendar and Outlook).


Expense Reporting:

Create an automated expense reporting system for business travelers.
Integrate with popular expense management software like Concur and Expensify.


Map Integration:

Incorporate map services (Google Maps and Apple Maps) for location-based recommendations and navigation assistance.
